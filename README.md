# Kepler.exe

This is my brand new GDI malware inspired by ArTicZera's malwares. It only took me a little over a week to create and I think it turned out well. I still have lots of improvement to do in making malwares.

Some of the things Kepler does are:
- ☠️ Overwriting the MBR (Master Boot Record)
- 🗑️ Deleting files from System32
- 🎲 Moving and making copies of itself
- 🫥 Hiding the taskbar
- ❌ Disabling Task Manager and Regedit
- 😵 Crashing the PC
- 📺 Displaying cool graphic effects
- 🎵 Playing bytebeats
- And much more (not really lol)

# ⚠️ Warning ⚠️

This is a destructive malware! Above are all the malicious things it does.
I'm not responsible for any damage done. There will be 2 warnings before starting the malware.
There is no safety version of this, only the destructive one! So running it will kill your PC.
I designed this to run on Windows XP, but it will probably work on newer versions of Windows.

To Skids: If you steal any effects you must credit me and make your malware open source.
